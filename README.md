1. to run:

```console
npm i
npm run start
npm run lint
npm run test
```

2. I Implemented pagination for the first api call and I din't have much time to continue rest (In the end is the same approach)

3. Time spend on this :
   setup with linter and prettier: 45 min
   implementation: 3h
   tests: 1h
   reading documentation: 1h (for bitmovin npm)

4. Improvements to make:

5. clear data if different api key is added. I din't test but I
   think that if you fetch more data it will just append to existing one in store
6. Better error handling
7. Improve code a bit
